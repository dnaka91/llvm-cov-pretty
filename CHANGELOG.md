## Unreleased

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous Tasks

- Bump actions/setup-node to v4 ([83fed52](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/83fed5275c8cedb9743a66a40463c03275dd150a))

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/compare/v0.1.8...v0.1.9) - 2023-10-10

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Remove non-existing extra schema fields ([d9e67b7](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/d9e67b762936b62d132ac5bbee9fee7b01d9fa6d))
  > These extra fields that `cargo-llvm-cov` adds were originally considered
  > but never actually made it in the schema. Thus, they cause the schema
  > parsing to fail.

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/compare/v0.1.7...v0.1.8) - 2023-10-06

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Features

- Allow to control the report's output directory ([458ede9](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/458ede98a235693ef7af80d913a744587b9e29d3))
  > A new CLI flag that allows to save the report to a user-defined
  > directory instead of the default `target/llvm-cov-pretty` location.
  > 
  > Caution should be taken as there is no additional logic for non-empty
  > directories. The target directory will be fully wiped in the process of
  > generating the report, without prior confirmation.
- Enable auto-wrapping of CLI help messages ([86cd5c7](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/86cd5c7ad853570095e5aa0aec2fff39ce9b6c7e))
  > By enabling clap's `wrap_help` feature, the help output is now nicely
  > aligned to the terminal wraps, which makes it easier to read in case of
  > longer help messages.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Set link for first uncovered line ([481434a](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/481434a271553ce5fea32bb1efe442a46611776b))
  > A link tag existed that should move to the first uncovered line in
  > source view, but it never contained a proper working URL.
  > 
  > Also, the link won't be generated anymore if there aren't any uncovered
  > lines in the file.

### üìö Documentation

- Correct the repo URL of links in CHANGELOG.md ([178b848](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/178b84814997666d52fefbc533f902171000173a))
  > In the previous improvement of the changelog format, the wrong
  > repository URL slipped in the settings as the file was copied over from
  > another project. This resulted in all link to point to the wrong
  > location.

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/compare/v0.1.6...v0.1.7) - 2023-09-25

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Features

- Mark partially-covered lines in yellow ([e3eafbd](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/e3eafbdd3a9bd998a5d371a0369a19f998bc964d))
  > So far lines that are covered but have missing function calls
  > (instantiations) were marked with red. To better indicate that they're
  > basically called but have a few missing instantiations a new yellow
  > color is introduced for those.
- Sort and deduplicate annotation messages ([fbcaf0e](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/fbcaf0eb85681e555292fc1052e50c42a79947e2))
  > The opt-in annotations for missing function calls and instantiations
  > are now sorted alphabetically and deduplicated to reduce the amount of
  > vertical space occupied.
- Add a new flag to disable usage of function coverage ([5dd1824](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/5dd18245a7632b10eee7243af031fb79ff4c2791))
  > A new flag that allows to opt-out of utilizing the function coverage
  > information in the source view. That means only basic file coverage will
  > be used if this flag is used.
  > 
  > Overview pages will still show the function coverage percentages
  > accordingly, regardless of the flag.

### üìö Documentation

- Improve changelog format ([2662278](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/266227895382700d0c56c434d4c75597094c2012))
  > Extend the changelog generator to create prettier changelogs, similar to
  > how the changelog in the `git-cliff` tool itself looks.

  > Therefore, the pin can be removed, but a minimum version of `1.0.185` is
  > required.

  > Pin `serde` to `1.0.171` to avoid pre-compiled binaries that are used
  > after for derive macros.

  > into the coverage JSON report. This allows for easier version checks and
  > location of the project's manifest file.

  > At first, it looked like the instantiation coverage always defines a
  > single line, but as it turns out there are cases where it streches over
  > more than one line.
  > 
  > This data must be included to properly display the overrides for
  > uncovered instantiations.
