### Bug Fixes

- Cover the full line range of instantiation data ([9303b6b](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/commit/9303b6b))
  > At first, it looked like the instantiation coverage always defines a
  > single line, but as it turns out there are cases where it streches over
  > more than one line.
  > 
  > This data must be included to properly display the overrides for
  > uncovered instantiations.
