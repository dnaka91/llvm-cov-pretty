# ðŸ’„ llvm-cov-pretty

More beautiful HTML reports for `llvm-cov` ([cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) specifically).

- Dark theme support (switches automatically based on your browser setting).
- Syntax highlighting.
- Reduced clutter from instantiation annotations.\
- More colors, because why not.
- Progress bars (like in grcov).

## A note on stability

This tool is still in its early stages, and the JSON output of `llvm-cov` has several quirks and complexities. Therefore, for the time being, always generate the regular HTML report as well and compare the output.

Please file an issue if you find any differences.

## Installation

Make sure you have [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov#installation) installed.

### From source

To build the project from source, you need a recent installation of Rust. The recommended installation method is through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Then open up a terminal and install the project as follows:

```sh
cargo install llvm-cov-pretty
```

The binary will be installed into your `$HOME/.cargo/bin` folder by default. Please make sure it is available from your `$PATH`.

### From AUR

Arch linux users can use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) to install the project from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org). For example, using `paru`:

```sh
paru -S llvm-cov-pretty
```

### Pre-build binaries

If you don't want to build the project yourself, you can download pre-build binaries instead. Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/dnaka91/llvm-cov-pretty/releases) and find the appropriate file for your platform.

## Requirements

Before you can use this tool, make sure the following steps are done:

- In addition to [installing `cargo-llvm-cov`](#installation), make sure you've run it at least once on your machine in any Rust project. It will jump into interactive mode and install any missing tools that it needs itself.
- It is expected that you are in the context of a Rust project. Ensure you invoke the program while located in a Rust project in your terminal.
  - However, you can pass the `--manifest-path` argument, but make sure you pass the same path to both `cargo-llvm-cov` and `llvm-cov-pretty`.

## Usage

The tool operates on the JSON output from llvm-cov. As cargo-llvm-cov directly prints those to the standard output, you can pipe the programs together like so:

```sh
cargo llvm-cov --json | llvm-cov-pretty
```

Of course you can do this in two steps as well:

```sh
cargo llvm-cov --json > coverage.json
llvm-cov-pretty coverage.json
```

There are a few extra commands (like generating shell completions) and options (like disabling instantiation annotations) as well. Have a look at the output of `llvm-cov-pretty --help`.

## Development

To start developing on the project, you'll need a few extra step in addition to the ones described in the [From source](#from-source) section.

- Install a recent version of Node.js and Yarn (usually comes bundled with Node.js).
- Ensure all submodules are initialized with `git submodule update --init`.

Then open up a new terminal and execute `yarn run watch`. It will watch the project files and rebuild the stylesheet at `assets/style.css` when needed. With that you're ready to hack along.

Before you create a custom build, it's recommended to stop the watch job again and run `yarn run build` once, which will create a minified and optimized version of the stylesheet. It is compiled into the binary during builds.
